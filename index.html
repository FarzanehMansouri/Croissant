          A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/, US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French:
          [kʁwasɑ̃] (audio speaker iconlisten)) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie
          pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France.
          Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like
          other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The
          dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
          succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
          laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar
          to a puff pastry.

          Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
          crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long
          been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and
          pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
          century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
          preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be
          freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
          Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast
          food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries
          and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
